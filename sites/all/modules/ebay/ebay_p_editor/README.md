ebay_p_editor is a group of modules that are used to edit the content. It is based on the Drupal CKEditor module and associated with some other plugin modules to simulate a wiki editing experience.

For detail usage and configuration, please refer to this [wiki page](https://wiki.vip.corp.ebay.com/display/eBayCMS/ebay_p_editor).

### Note

All the editor related modules depends on the CKEditor module.

The CKEditor module is just a container which actually runs a Javascript based [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) library. 

***Currently we are using CKEditor v4.2 as the library for testing all our plugin modules. I am not sure whether there will be any issue for other version.***

You need to download the library and put it inside the CKEditor module folder.
