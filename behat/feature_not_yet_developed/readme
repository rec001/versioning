This folder holds all the features for tasks 
which have not been developed. As per our 
standard operating procedure  behat test
requirement ie 'features' will be made before hand.

The reason for keeping the features here is 
avoid unneccesary failure reports for tasks
which we have not yet started.

If you are the developer who has been assigned a
task you should find the feature here and then move
it to the feature folder to test it.
